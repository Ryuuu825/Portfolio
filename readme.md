# A Portfolio Website of myself

The website is available at [here](https://ryuuu825.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Background

This project started as a way to practice my skills in Bootstrap, which I needed to finish my assignment, and "web develop ". Besides, I wanted to make a portfolio website and put this on my CV.

So, please don't blame me if the website is bad.
